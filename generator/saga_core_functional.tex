 \label{sec:func}
 
  The Functional SAGA API packages define the functional SAGA
  API scope, as motivated in the Introduction and
  in~\cite{saga-req}.  
 
  \subsection*{General Properties of Functional API Classes and
  Instances}
  
  The interfaces, classes and methods defined in this part of
  the specification are, in general, representing explicit
  entities and actions of some backend system.  As such, all
  operations on these entities are, in general, subject to
  authentication and authorization.  In order
  to simplify the specification, the following exceptions are
  not separately motivated: |AuthenticationFailed|,
  \T{Authorization\-Failed}, |PermissionDenied|, |Timeout|,
  |NoSuccess|.  These exceptions have then exactly the semantics
  as indicated in their description in Section~\ref{ssec:error}.
  Additionally, the conventions for the exceptions
  |NotImplemented| and |IncorrectURL| apply as described in
  Section~\ref{sec:nonfunc}.
