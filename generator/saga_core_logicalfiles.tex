 
   This section of the SAGA API describes the interaction with
   replica systems.  Numerous SAGA use cases required replica
   management functionality in the API -- however, only a small
   number of operation have been requested.  The methods
   described here are hence limited to the creation and
   maintainance of logical files, replicas, and to search on
   logical file meta data.
 
   The |saga::logical_file| class implements the
   |saga::attributes| interface.  It is important to realize that
   this is intended to reflect the ability of replica
   systems to associate meta data with logical files.  The SAGA
   attribute model (string based key/value pairs) can, with all
   probability, only give a crude representation of
   meta data models used in real world replica systems --
   however, the definition of a more abstract and comprehensive
   data model for replica meta data was felt to be outside the
   scope of a SAGA API definition.  Implementations are expected
   to map the native data model to key/value pairs as well as
   possible, and MUST document that mapping process (and in
   particular the supported keys) carefully.
 
   Please note that the interactions with logical files as
   opaque entities (as entries in logical file name spaces) are
   covered by the |namespace| package.  The interfaces presented
   here supplement the |namespace| package with operations for
   operating on entries in replica catalogues.
 
   It is up to the used backend to ensure that multiple
   replica locations registered on a logical file are indeed
   identical copies -- the SAGA API does not imply any specific
   consistency model.  The SAGA implementation MUST document the
   consistency model used.
 
   \subsubsection{Definitions}
 
    \paragraph{Logical File:} A \I{logical file} represents
    merely an entry in a name space which has (a) an associated
    set of registered (physical) replicas of that file, and (b)
    an associated set of meta data describing that logical file.
    Both sets can be empty.  To access the \I{content}
    of a logical file, a \T{saga::file} needs to be created with
    one of the registered replica locations.
 
    \paragraph{Replica:} A \I{replica} (or \I{physical file}) is
    a file which is registered on a logical file.  In general,
    all replicas registered on the same logical file are
    identical.  Often, one of these replicas is deemed to be a
    master copy (often it is the first replica
    registered, and/or the only one which can be changed) --
    that distinction is, however, not visible in the SAGA API.
 
    \paragraph{Logical Directory:} A \I{logical directory}
    represents a directory entry in the name space of logical
    files.  Several replica system implementations have the
    notion of \I{container}s, which, for our purposes, represent
    directories which can have, just as logical files,
    associated sets of meta data.  In the presented API, logical
    directories and containers are the same.
 
    % Note that the 'Truncate' flag on opening logical files is
    % interpreted as to truncate the set of registered replicas on
    % that logical file -- the associated meta data set is \I{not}
    % truncated.
 
    Note that the |Truncate|, |Append| and |Binary| flags have no
    meaning on logical files.  The respective enum values for these
    flags for |saga::file|s have been reserved though, for (a) future
    use, and (b) consistency with the |saga::file| flag values.
 
    The |find()| method of the |saga::logical_directory| class
    represents a combination of (a) the |find()| method from the
    |saga::ns_directory| class, and (b) the |find_attributes()|
    method from the |saga::attributes| interface.  The method
    accepts patterns for meta data matches
    (\T{attr\_pattern}) and a single pattern for file
    name matches (|name_pattern|), and returns a list of logical
    file names which match
    all \T{attr\_pattern} and the \T{name\_pattern} (\T{AND}
    semantics).  The \T{attr\_pattern} are formatted as
    defined for |find_attribute()| of the |saga::attributes|
    interface.  The |name_pattern| are formatted as defined for
    the |find()| method of the |saga::ns_directory| class.  In
    general, the allowed patterns are the same as defined as
    wildcards in the description of the SAGA
    |namespace| package.

  \subsubsection*{Class \T{logical\_file}}

      Notes:    - this method returns an array of urls
                  containing the complete set of locations
                  associated with the logical file.
                - an empty array returned is not an error - 
                  the logical file object is still a valid 
                  object (see replicate() method description).
                - if the logical file was opened WriteOnly, an
                  'PermissionDenied' exception is thrown.
 
 
    - replicate 
      Purpose:  replicate a file from any of the known
                replica locations to a new location, and, on 
                success, add the new replica location to the 
                set of associated replicas 
      Format:   replicate        (in  url       name, 
                                  in  int       flags = None);
      Inputs:   name:             location to replicate to
                flags:            flags defining the operation
                                  modus
      InOuts:   -
      Outputs:  -
      PreCond:  -
      PostCond: - an identical copy of one of the available
                  replicas exists at name.
                - name is in the list of replica locations
                  for the logical file.
      Perms:    Read 
                Write
      Throws:   NotImplemented
                IncorrectURL

                Timeout
                NoSuccess
      Notes:    - the method implies a two step operation:
                  1) create a new and complete replica at the
                     given location, which then represents
                     a new replica location.
                  2) perform an add_location() for the new
                     replica location.
                - all notes to the saga::ns_entry::copy() and
                  saga::logical_file::add_location methods
                  apply.
                - the method is not required to be atomic, but:
                  the implementation MUST be either
                  successful in both steps, or throw an
                  exception indicating if both methods failed, 
                  or if one of the methods succeeded.
                - a replicate call on an instance with empty
                  location set raises an 'IncorrectState'
                  exception, with an descriptive error message.  
                - the default flags are 'None' (0).  The
                  interpretation of flags is as described for 
                  the ns_entry::copy() method.  
                - The 'Recursive' flag is not allowed, and 
                  causes a 'BadParameter' exception.
                - if the logical file was opened ReadOnly, an
                  'PermissionDenied' exception is thrown.
                - if the logical file was opened WriteOnly, an
                  'PermissionDenied' exception is thrown.

  \subsubsection*{Class \T{logical\_directory}}
 
    This class represents a container for logical files in a
    logical file name space.  It allows traversal of the
    catalog's name space, and the manipulation and creation
    (open) of logical files in that name space.

      Notes:    - the description of find() in the Introduction

                - the semantics for both the find_attributes()
                  method in the saga::attributes interface and 
                  for the find() method in the 
                  saga::ns_directory class apply.  On 
                  conflicts, the find() semantic supersedes 
                  the find_attributes() semantic.  Only entries
                  matching all attribute patterns and the name 
                  space pattern are returned.
                - the default flags are 'Recursive' (2).
