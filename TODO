  - keep parts of the instance_data read_only, so that one
    adaptor cannot temper with instance data, and spoil init for
    other adaptors.  Only state related instance data (file
    pointer, job id, etc) should be mutable.  Define those, also
    for advert publishing.

  - provide adaptor programmers with status check and monitoring
    threads automatically, and take care of thread resource
    management.

  - all objects should have a mutex, and lock it in non-const
    functions.  kind of.

  - allow an adaptor to statically bind, i.e. to bypass adaptor
    selection on following calls.  That improves performance
    for, for example, the message API, where the same channel
    has to be used anyway
