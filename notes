saga-simple is not providing orthogonal functionality, like logging.  So, we are
free to invent and use our own log system (for example), and don't expect others
to use it (adaptor developers, SAGA users / application coders, etc.  They
*can*, but are not expected to.

  - locks
  - shared_ptr
  - log
  - ini parser
  - ...


filesystem::file::impl::constructor should call the namespace constructor, and
this in turn the object: constructor, which then can invoke the object adaptor
-- otherwise, an object adaptor would be useless.  This is yet another way to do
adaptor chaining, and allows to overload simple saga::object properties etc.
Note that the upper constructors should be called *before* invoking the CPI, so
that the upstream objects are initialized properly...
